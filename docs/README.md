# Crowd-Kit: Computational Quality Control for Crowdsourcing

**Crowd-Kit** is a powerful Python library that implements commonly-used aggregation methods for crowdsourced annotation and offers the relevant metrics and datasets. We strive to implement functionality that simplifies working with crowdsourced data.

Currently, Crowd-Kit contains:

* implementations of commonly-used aggregation methods for categorical, pairwise, textual, and segmentation responses
* metrics of uncertainty, consistency, and agreement with aggregate
* loaders for popular crowdsourced datasets

*The library is currently in a heavy development state, and interfaces are subject to change.*

## Installing

Installing Crowd-Kit is as easy as `pip install crowd-kit`

## Getting Started

This example shows how to use Crowd-Kit for categorical aggregation using the classical Dawid-Skene algorithm.

First, let us do all the necessary imports.

````python
from crowdkit.aggregation import DawidSkene
from crowdkit.datasets import load_dataset

import pandas as pd
````

Then, you need to read your annotations into Pandas DataFrame with columns `task`, `performer`, `label`. Alternatively, you can download an example dataset.

````python
df = pd.read_csv('results.csv')  # should contain columns: task, performer, label
# df, ground_truth = load_dataset('relevance-2')  # or download an example dataset
````

Then you can aggregate the performer responses as easily as in scikit-learn:

````python
aggregated_labels = DawidSkene(n_iter=100).fit_predict(df)
````
