    Segmentation RASA - chooses a pixel if sum of weighted votes of each performers' more than 0.5.

    Algorithm works iteratively, at each step, the performers are reweighted in proportion to their distances
    to the current answer estimation. The distance is considered as $1 - IOU$. Modification of the RASA method
