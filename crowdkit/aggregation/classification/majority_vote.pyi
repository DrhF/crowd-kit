class MajorityVote(crowdkit.aggregation.base.BaseClassificationAggregator):
    """Majority Vote aggregation algorithm.

    Majority vote is a straightforward approach for categorical aggregation: for each task,
    it outputs a label which has the largest number of responses. Additionaly, the majority vote
    can be used when different weights assigned for performers' votes. In this case, the
    resulting label will be the one with the largest sum of weights.


    **Note:** in case when two or more labels have the largest number of votes, the resulting
    label will be the same for all tasks which have the same set of labels with equal count of votes.

    Args:
        default_skill: Defualt performer's weight value.

    Examples:
        Basic majority voting:
        >>> from crowdkit.aggregation import MajorityVote
        >>> from crowdkit.datasets import load_dataset
        >>> df, gt = load_dataset('relevance-2')
        >>> result = MajorityVote().fit_predict(df)

        Weighted majority vote:
        >>> import pandas as pd
        >>> from crowdkit.aggregation import MajorityVote
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame(
        >>>     [
        >>>         ['t1', 'p1', 0],
        >>>         ['t1', 'p2', 0],
        >>>         ['t1', 'p3', 1],
        >>>         ['t2', 'p1', 1],
        >>>         ['t2', 'p2', 0],
        >>>         ['t2', 'p3', 1],
        >>>     ],
        >>>     columns=['task', 'performer', 'label']
        >>> )
        >>> skills = pd.Series({'p1': 0.5, 'p2': 0.7, 'p3': 0.4})
        >>> result = MajorityVote.fit_predict(df, skills)
    Attributes:
        labels_ (typing.Optional[pandas.core.series.Series]): Tasks' labels.
            A pandas.Series indexed by `task` such that `labels.loc[task]`
            is the tasks's most likely true label.

        skills_ (typing.Optional[pandas.core.series.Series]): Performers' skills.
            A pandas.Series index by performers and holding corresponding performer's skill
        probas_ (typing.Optional[pandas.core.frame.DataFrame]): Tasks' label probability distributions.
            A pandas.DataFrame indexed by `task` such that `result.loc[task, label]`
            is the probability of `task`'s true label to be equal to `label`. Each
            probability is between 0 and 1, all task's probabilities should sum up to 1

        on_missing_skill (str): How to handle assignments done by workers with unknown skill.
            Possible values:
                    * "error" — raise an exception if there is at least one assignment done by user with unknown skill;
                    * "ignore" — drop assignments with unknown skill values during prediction. Raise an exception if there is no 
                    assignments with known skill for any task;
                    * value — default value will be used if skill is missing.
